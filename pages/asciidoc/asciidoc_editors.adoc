== Asciidoc

Like http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown], http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc] is a markup
language. It can be written with any text editor, but some are better.

== Atom

First, you can read this link:mydoc_atom_text_editor[Atom page] as an introduction.

For Asciidoc authoring, you can install theses plugins:

* https://atom.io/packages/language-asciidoc[Language Asciidoc].
* https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc Preview].

With theses two plugins, editing Asciidoc page is really pleasant: the best editor choice, IMHO.

== Sublime Text

https://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime Text] is another great text editor, but it is not free.

It also has good plugins for Asciidoc support:

* https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AsciiDoc[Asciidoc language support]
* https://packagecontrol.io/packages/OmniMarkupPreviewer[OmniMarkupPreviewer] for previewing documents.

== WebStorm

link:mydoc_webstorm_text_editor[WebStorm] is one of the best web editors. It has plugins for Asciidoc support
and document preview. It is a great editor, but much more heavy than Atom or Sublime Text. Since Asciidoc is
a markup language, WebStorm is too heavy IMHO.

== Other editors (not tested)

* https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
* https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepadd++] (Windows only)
