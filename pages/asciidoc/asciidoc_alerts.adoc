## About alerts

Alerts are little warnings, info, or other messages that you have called out in special formatting.

## Alerts

Alerts are a native function of Asciidoc syntax: see the "admonition" section of the
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#more-delimited-blocks[Syntax Quick Reference Guide].

### Single paragraph alerts

[source]
----
NOTE: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.
----

Here's the result:

NOTE: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.

### Multiple paragraph alerts

Using the block syntax, an alert can contain multiple paragraphs with complex formatting (lists, tables, etc.).

[source]
----
[TIP]
====
Here is my tip.

With a second paragraph... and a list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
====
----

Here is the result:

[TIP]
====
Here is my tip.

With a second paragraph, and a list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
====

### Types of alerts available

There are five types of alerts you can leverage:

* NOTE
* TIP
* WARNING
* IMPORTANT
* CAUTION (using the WARNING style, since Bootstrap provides only 4 different alert styles)

Here is the result for each type:

NOTE: This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.

IMPORTANT: This is my important message. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.

WARNING: This is my warning. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.

CAUTION: This is my caution. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.

TIP: This is my tip. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph.


## Callouts

### Usage

link:mydoc_alerts.html[Theme native callouts] are not supported yet using Asciidoc syntax. They can be emulated
using HTML in a "passthrough" block:

[source]
----
++++
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">Callout</div>
++++
----

Here's the result:

++++
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">Callout</div>
++++

An alternative way is to enable the `page-liquid` attribute in the header, and to use the `include` macro in a
passthrough block:

[source]
----
++++
{% raw %}{% include callout.html content="This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. " type="primary" %} {% endraw %}
++++
----

Here's the result:

++++
{% include callout.html content="This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a
type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning
multiple paragraphs." type="primary" %}
++++

IMPORTANT: It's just a stylistic preference whether to use an alert or callout. *But since alerts are native in Asciidoc,
I recommand using alerts.*

### Callout types

The available callout types are :

* `danger` (red)
* `default` (grey)
* `primary` (dark blue)
* `success` (green)
* `info` (light blue)
* `warning` (yellow)

Here's the result for each type:

++++
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">Danger callout</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default">Default callout</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">Primary callout</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">Success callout</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">Info callout</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">Warning callout</div>
++++

## Use Liquid variables inside parameters with includes

IMPORTANT: In order to use liquid variables and filters, the page header must contain the `page-liquid` attribute.

[source]
----
{% raw %}WARNING: The "{{ site.company_name }}" is pleased to announce an upcoming release.{% endraw %}
----

Here is the result:

WARNING: The "{{ site.company_name }}" is pleased to announce an upcoming release.
