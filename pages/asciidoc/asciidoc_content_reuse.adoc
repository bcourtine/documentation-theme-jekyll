== About content reuse

You can embed content from one file inside another using includes.

[source]
----
 include::data/test.adoc[]
----

Here is the result:

include::data/test.adoc[]

'''

IMPORTANT: Include path is *relative to the document that performs the include*. This configuration
allows inclusion to work both in HTML and PDF generation with Asciidoc PDF. If you prefer a path relative
to Jekyll site root, you can remove the `base_dir: :docdir` line from `_config.yml`.

== Classic include usages

Includes are usually used for:

* Including a source code from an external file. See link:asciidoc_code_samples.html[Asciidoc Code samples]
for an example.
* Included a big table content from an external file (CSV). See link:asciidoc_tables.html[Asciidoc Tables]
for an example.
