Theme author is link:mydoc_about.md[Tom Johnson], technical writer, blogger, and podcaster based in San Jose, California.

The Asciidoc extension and for this theme is developped by Benoît Courtine, a french software engineer and
https://blog.courtine.org/[blogger].

I have used this theme for professional documentation projects. But I prefer using Asciidoc for writting technical
documents. So I adapted the Jekyll theme to support Asciidoc, and Asciidoc templates to get a rendering similar
to original theme (alerts, FAQ, code highlighting, etc.).

These Asciidoc developments are fairly stable, and since I used this theme for free, I am also releasing the Asciidoc
extensions for free.
